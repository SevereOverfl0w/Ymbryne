== Explain

Chestnut holds a custom mount of figwheel, which means that the usual strategy
for doing `:Piggieback` doesn't work.

Instead you have to grab the figwheel system out of Chestnut's own system
(`(:figwheel-system reloaded.repl/system)`), and then use the function figwheel
uses to get the repl-env out of that (`figwheel-sidecar.system/repl-env`).

`nil` is the build-id you want to attach to. Leave it nil if you only have one.

This does rely on some internals of figwheel, so it may break some day, in
which case you should look at the source of
`figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/repl-env` to figure out how it is implemented.
